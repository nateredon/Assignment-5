# Assignment 5
This repository contains folders __"data"__ and __"figures"__.  
  
In this project I look at the variability in gillnet panel depth at various different sites in the Michigan waters of Lake Superior. I make a rough exploratory plot and then create an expository violin plot to examine this. 

__Data__ contains a raw .csv dataset to be analyzed as well. The data come from the {FSAdata} package, which was created by Derek Ogle as part of his book Introductory Fisheries Analysis with R. The dataset contains information on the ages (subsample), and length and mass (all fish) for male and female Siscowet Lake Trout captured at four locations in Michigan waters of Lake Superior.  
  
__Figures__ contains the output figures from my analysis, the images used to label figure axes, and the raw R Markdown document containing the code.
